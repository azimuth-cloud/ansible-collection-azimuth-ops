  # Because of resource constraints, we want to restrict concurrency:
  #
  #   * Only one active workflow run at a time across all branches, others should be queued
  #   * New workflow runs should cancel any in-progress runs for the same branch only
  #
  # The GitHub native concurrency cannot express this, so we use a custom action to queue
  # This will wait for an available slot until the action times out or is cancelled
